Cluster Map Allocations:
    - If no space aviable to allocate a cluster map, the first sector fo the cluster should be used as a new map


TODOS:
    - Add checks for entry types and if they are actually files/directories/clusters
    - Parse Mappings into cluster and sector to alow for a larger System range to be founbd (Not limited to uint64_t instead of uint64_t+uint16_t)
